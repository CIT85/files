# Project 2: Setup and Styling Instructions

## 1. Set Up Your Project Folder

- Fix any issues you had in `p1`.  
- Inside your **private repo**, create a new folder named `p2`.
- Copy the **final version** of your code from `p1` into the `p2` folder.


**Initial Commit:**  
Use the commit message:  
```bash
git commit -m "setup done"
```

## 2. Style Your Pages (65 points)

You will begin styling your site using only what we have covered in **Chapters 1–13**.

### ✅ Requirements

- Use **only CSS concepts** introduced in Chapters 1–13.
- Your CSS should show:
  - Understanding of the **cascade**
  - Ability to follow **best practices**

### ❌ Do NOT:

- Use **Grid**, **Flexbox**, **Media Queries**, or any topics covered after Chapter 13.
- Use **CSS libraries or frameworks**.
- Use excessive `<div>` elements — keep them to a **minimum**. More than a few will result in point deductions.

### 🎨 Additional Instructions

- On your `site.html`, select a **color palette** and display it on the page.

> Your site doesn’t have to be perfect — it should show how well you can apply what you’ve learned.

## 3. Commits and Documentation (35 points)

You will be graded based on your **commit history** and **CSS documentation**.

### 💾 Commit Guidelines

- Make a commit each time you complete styling for a part of your site.
- Use **clear and concise commit messages**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "started body ruleset"
  git commit -m "finished banner class"
  ```

- The **more commits**, the better — they show your **progress and process**.

### 💬 CSS Documentation

- Include **comments in your CSS** to explain how each ruleset contributes to your page design.
