## Chapter - 1 (0:00 to 0:14:50)

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will be w4_css (week 4 css). Code along and create a new index.html (with basic tags) and main.css, then link the main.css to the index.html, before you start the css code along. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup for week 4 css done"**

* Create a new markdown file in your w4_css folder and name it css.md and in there write our understanding of what cascading means. Use a heading in the markdown with text "What is cascading" and once you write the inline style before it is delete, commit

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "external, internal and inline styles"**
