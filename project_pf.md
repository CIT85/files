# Final Phase: 

In this final phase, you will publish your completed website in a public GitHub repository, add two new content pages (`contact.html` and `about.html`), and implement a visually impactful hero section using CSS `background-size: cover`. You’ll also reflect on your progress and give feedback to a classmate. This project is worth a total of **100 points** and will demonstrate your understanding of HTML, CSS, accessibility, layout consistency, and design documentation.

## 1. Set Up Your Public Project Folder (15 points)

- In your **public repository**, create a new folder named `final`.  
- Inside the `final` folder, create a subfolder named `img`.
- Copy the final version of your HTML and CSS files from your `p4` folder into the new `final` folder.
- Copy the image files from your **private repository** into the new `final/img` folder.
- Update all image references in your HTML and CSS files to reflect the new image folder path:
  - Use **VSCode's Find and Replace** feature to update all paths efficiently.
  - While you *can* do it manually, using Find and Replace is strongly recommended as a best practice and time-saver.
- **Test your project** in the browser to ensure that images and styling are still working before committing your changes.

✅ **Commit Message**:  `"setup for public final folder and updated image paths"`

## 2. Add a Contact Page with a Form (15 points)

- Create a new file named `contact.html` in your `final` folder.
- Link to this page **from the footer** of your site.
- Also include a reference to this new page in your `site.html` file.

### On `contact.html`:
- Write a short paragraph **about yourself** and why you created this site. Place this content **before the form**.
- Create a **contact form** using semantic HTML:
  - Use a `<form>` element wrapped in a `<fieldset>`.
  - Include `<label>` elements for accessibility.
  - Include at least **three different types of inputs** (e.g., text, email, textarea, select).
  - Use the `required` attribute on your inputs.

### Style and Validate:
- Style the form to **match the rest of your site**.
- Validate your HTML and CSS.
- Ensure that **all images and links work correctly**.

✅ **Commit Message**:  `"contact form and styling done"`

## 3. Add a Hero Image with `background-size: cover` (15 points)

- Choose a **hero image** that reflects the theme or tone of your website.
- Add the hero image as a **background image** to a section at the top of at least one of your HTML pages.
- Use `background-size: cover` and related properties to ensure the image is responsive and visually balanced.
- This is only required on **one page**, but may be used on more.

### Guidelines:
- Place the hero section near the top of the page.
- Ensure the background image is centered, responsive, and does not repeat.
- Ensure any overlaid text is easy to read.

### README Documentation:
- In your `README.md` file, add the following heading:

  ```markdown
  ## Hero Image Design
  ```

- Write about:
  - Why you chose the image
  - Where it appears
  - Your design choices for placement, layout, and contrast

✅ **Commit Message**:  
`"added hero image with background-size cover"`

## 4. Create an About Page and Update the Menu (10 points)

- Create a new file named `about.html` in your `final` folder.

- Write a few paragraphs describing your **site’s purpose and content**:
  - What is this site about?
