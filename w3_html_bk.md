https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA

In week 3 attendance I showed how to setup w3_html folder. 

## Chapter - 6 (1:30:33 to 2:00:33) 

* Code along using the img folder we created in the root of your private repo and then select the images in Dave's 06_lesson folder and once you click on each one right click and save image as and select the folder to same them into or after they are downloaded move them into the img folder we just created. 

* Make sure you listen carefully as Dave discussed current practices for coding images, understand "below the folder" and attributes for loading images. Make sure you add the br (yes 150) and learn about how to best the lazy loading of images in Chrome devTools. 
* In the README.md add a heading 1 using text 'Images' and include some of the key points that Dave makes here. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "adding 2 images and lazing loading"**

* Remove the br's and continue doing with Dave and add the figure and figcaption tags and the how to the the code tag. Validate your code and also learn about the different resources and tools for working with images. Take note of the site for future reference and add notes into your README.md regarding the figure and figcaption. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "figure, figcaption, code"**

## Chapter - 7 (2:00:59 to 2:26:01)

* Code along with Dave and learn about semantic (meaning) tags we have already used and get introduced to new semantic tags. Commit right before Dave start to discuss changing the section tags.
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "header, main, footer"**

* Continue to code along and learn about articles, aside, summary, details and mark. It was nice to see how the p tag worked with the details. After Dave uses time tag, commit.
* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "more semantic tags"**

* I'll cover this in the video for this item, if you are unable to get the extension to show up, which happened to be me, I'll show you how to get that to show. I do recommend using the extension Dave discusses for showing the semantic outline. 

* Great comments about div and span!! 

* In this chapter Dave discusses the general guidelines for how and where to use the semantic tags.  In the README.md add a md heading 1 'Semantic Tags' and write your understanding of the guidelines Dave discussed.  You can also do some additional research and/or re-watch this section.  

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "my understanding of semantic usage guidelines"**

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)

Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* You need to submit your github history URL to how you are have completed this up to this point and will finish the last chapter tomorrow.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the first due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. Reach out if you have questions about this option. 

## Chapter - 8 (2:26:01 to 2:40:01)

* Code along and learn how to code tables. Right after Dave applies the css to the table commit.

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "tables tags and css"**

* Open Chrome DevTools and follow along with Dave. 

* Code along with Dave add the semantics tags thead, tbody scope attribute, then commit. It was good learn about how the scope is easier then using id's. Make sure you validate your code, but I generally do this after each commit so I catch it early. 
* Make sure you add notes and a md heading 1 the 'tables'

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "table headings, row and column spans"**

## Chapter - 9 (2:40:01 to 3:25:33) 

* Code along with Dave and create the anchor link and the article and heading for the contact me form.  Once the first name input field is complete. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "first name input on form complete"**

* Code along and create last name, password and phone. Dave does touch on regular expression here!  If you want to know more, I suggest using chatGPT as it does a good job on explaining this in more detail.  
* Add a md heading 1 and notes to your README.md for this topic. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "last name, password and phone form inputs complete"**

* Code along and create decade and the coffee select inputs for the form.  It was really fun to learn about the optgroup tag! 
* Add a md heading 1 and notes to your README.md for this topic. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "decade input and coffee select tag complete"**

* Continue to code along as Dave show an alternative to the select, you can pause the video and write the code on the screen. After adding the fav food fieldset commit.
* Add a md heading 1 and notes to your README.md for this topic. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "fieldset for fav food"**

* Continue to code with Dave and create the fieldsets and inputs for pets, and message using textarea, commit before doing the submit button.
* Add a md heading 1  notes to your README.md for this topic. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "radio, checkbox and textarea input types"**

* Now code the submit, post and reset button and learn how to see the form submission data from the action on the form. Good to know the difference between the get and post methods on a form! Make sure to validate.
* Add a md heading 1 and notes to your README.md for this topic. 

* **COMMIT MESSAGE - "submit, reset and post buttons and httpbin output"**

## Congratulations
You have finished your second code along for our class, push your code to github and give your commit history URL for the w3_html folder to show you have completed this work.
