https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA

In the video Dave will change his folder for each lesson, but for our work we will name the folder for the week and subject we are coding along with, so for this week it will w2_html (week 2 HTML).  

# For Week 2 Attendance you will code along chapter 1 and 2. 

## Chapter - 1 (00:00 to 12:44)
* Dave will cover the basic setup, here is the list of setup tasks and recommended extension for our course.
    - Downloaded and install Chrome on your system
        - Chrome Browser Dark Tab is optional
    - You already have VSCODE downloaded and installed, we did this last week in the dev env setup.
    - We will use a different folder structure then Dave:
        * In your pri repo create a new folder and name it w2_html (our file and folder naming convention will be lowercase and no spaces)
        * Only exception is README.md file
    - Code along as Dave demonstrates the basic HTML tags. 
    - I do **NOT** recommend installing the Prettier extension in VSCODE. 
    - I do recommend having the auto-save set in VSCODE.
    - VSCODE icon and Github Theme are optional.
    - Live Server extension is required.
        - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "setup and basic tag"**

## Chapter - 1  (12:44 to 19:58) 
* Pause the video and code up the CSS as Dave demonstrates. 
* Walk thru the W3C validation check and update the html along with Dave and make sure your html code validates before you continue, click for validator - https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload
    
## Chapter - 2 (19:58 to 28:52)
* Code along with Dave as he add more meta data in the head section. You can find the ico file here: 	
    - https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course/blob/main/02_lesson/html5.png,  
        - you can right click and save it into the current folder (w2_html) or move it from the downloaded folder to the current folder. 
        - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "fixed errors, added meta data and favicon"**
* Continue coding along with Dave to create the external stylesheet and name it main.css. 
* Create the error and run the validation. 
    - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "external stylesheet"**
* Follow instructions in canvas to complete the attendance post

# Week 2 Code Along Chapter 3, 4 and 5

## Chapter - 3 (28:52 to 49:36)
* Code along with Dave to learn about text content
    - Give that keyboard shortcut a try!  
    - I noticed mine did not change the h2 ending tag, I found a fix here: 
        * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51803668/visual-studio-code-how-to-automatically-change-the-matching-closing-tag
* It is important to understand the hierarchy of the headings and create the horizontal rule and understand white space collapsing.  
* Code along as Dave adds some content, you can make up your own content.
    - Just make sure to have all the same tags
* Then listen carefully as Dave discusses block vs inline elements.  
    - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "block vs inline text"**
* Code along to and learn about entities and learn about <abbr> and how it is not accessible, but <address> does.
* Code along with adding comment into your code. 
* Validate your file again and make sure you have valid html code
    - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "entities"**


## Chapter - 4 (49:36 to 59:56)
* Code along with Dave and learn about list.
    - It is good productivity practice to also learn about the keyboard shorts.
* Commit after he covers ol, ul and dl. 
    - Make sure your code is valid.
    - **COMMIT MESSAGE - "od, ul, and dl"**

    ### W3C Validation Extension
    - I'll cover this in the video for this week, but at this point I installed W3C Web Validator v1.3.1, it worked great and was much quicker than uploading the file. 

    ### Prettier and W3C Validation
    - I have also noticed that prettier is creating some issues with self closing tags.  This is why I don't recommending install that extension.

## BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT (Optional)
Because you have worked hard to get to this point:
* You need to submit your github history URL to how you are have completed this up to this point and will finish the last chapter by the Thursday due date.  
* This is optional and if you are feel you are able to keep focused them continue on.  
* If you missed the Monday due date for this work and you are trying to use this break to get caught up, complete the entire code along work for this item by the Thursday due date and I will reduce your points by 10% and not the normal late work reduction of 25%. 
* Submitting after the Thursday night due date does reduce your points by 25%.

## Chapter - 5 (59:56to 1:30:33)
* Code along with dave as you learn about hyperlinks. Make sure you understand the different type of link discussed here.  Absolute vs Relative. Attempt the file creation and before you move, do the following:

    * **COMMIT MESSAGE - "my attempt at creating the about.html page"**

* Update anything you missed and use word wrap (View >> Word Wrap or ctrl + z) if you want to have the the p tag wrap.  

* Continue coding with Dave to create the different type of links on the page, once you create the bottom of the page anchor page and Dave talks about best practices for writing link tags, stop and commit.

    * **COMMIT MESSAGE - "types of links"**

* Continue coding with Dave and learn about the some of the other types of link you can create.  

* HEADS UP if you have our base folder open here (CIT85SP25) the ```<a href="/">``` will not work as excepted.  This is why I will open the folder (rio-pri) that I am working on to have the folder be the "root" folder. 
    - or just remove the / and have ```<a href="">``` 
    - Make sure you validate your code and then commit.

    * **COMMIT MESSAGE - "download, mail, tel links and other attitudes"**

## Congratulations
You have finished your first code along for our class, push your code to github and give your commit history URL for the w2_html folder to show you have completed this work. 

This is how I will grade your work:
1. Did you provide the correct URL for w2_html folder commits = 5 points.
2. Did you do all the commits required for this work = 40 points
3. Did your commit have all the code along work =  40 points
4. Was index.html free of validation errors  = 15 points
- Work submitted after the due date will be reduced by 25 points. If you completed all the requirements above, but submitted after the due date you will get 75 points (100 - 25) on this work.
