# Project Phase 3: Modern Layout Planning and Implementation

## 1. Set Up Your Project Folder (5 points)

- In your **private repository**, inside the `project` folder, create a new folder called `p3`.
- Copy the final code from `p2` into the new `p3` folder.

âœ… **Commit Message**: `"setup for p3 done"`

---

## 2. Fix Phase 2 Issues Before Starting (5 points)

Before beginning Phase 3 work, review any feedback or required corrections from Phase 2 grading.

- Fix all issues that were identified in your Phase 2 feedback.
- Validate your HTML and CSS again after making fixes.

âœ… **Commit Message**: `"fixing phase 2"`

---

## 3. Visual Layout Planning Using Markdown (15 points)

Before coding Phase 3, create a **Visual Layout Sketch** using **Markdown syntax**.

Create a file: `layout-plan.md` inside your `p3/` folder.

### Your Markdown plan must include:
- **Hierarchy** of page elements (containers, sections, navigation, etc.)
- **Labels** on which parts will use **Flexbox** and/or **Grid**
- **Visual tree structure** (bullets, nesting, or arrows)

You may update your `layout-plan.md` as you work, but you must commit each time you make meaningful changes.

### Example Layout Sketch:

Example 1:
```
# Homepage Layout Plan
- Header (Flexbox)
  - Logo (left)
  - Navigation links (right)
- Main Content (Grid)
  - Section 1 (Grid - 2 columns)
    - Text (left)
    - Image (right)
  - Section 2 (Flexbox)
    - Feature 1 (centered)
    - Feature 2 (centered)
- Footer (Flexbox)
  - Contact info (left)
  - Social links (right)
```

Example 2:
```
Header (Flexbox)
â”œâ”€â”€ Logo (left)
â””â”€â”€ Nav Menu (right)

Main (Grid)
â”œâ”€â”€ Section 1 (2-column Grid)
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Article
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Image
â”œâ”€â”€ Section 2 (Flexbox row)
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Card 1
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Card 2
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Card 3

Footer (Flexbox)
â”œâ”€â”€ Address (left)
â””â”€â”€ Social Icons (right)
```

âœ… **Commit Message**: `"created initial layout plan"`
âœ… **When you revise**: `"updated layout-plan to change footer to flexbox"`

---

## 4. Refactor Layout Using BOTH Flexbox and Grid (60 points)

- You must apply **both** CSS Flexbox **and** CSS Grid in your project.
- You can use Flexbox or Grid for **page layout**, **specific content sections**, or **both** â€” depending on what makes sense for your design.
- Your `layout-plan.md` must clearly show where Flexbox and Grid are used.
- Your final site must demonstrate the practical use of both layout systems.


âœ… **Commit Message Examples**:
- `"implemented flexbox header layout"`
- `"created grid layout for section 2"`

---

## 5. Add One New Subpage (10 points)

- Create a **new subpage** for your project.
- The new subpage must:
  - Be linked from one of your existing menu pages.
  - Be linked from your `site.html` page.
  - Follow the same structure and content quality requirements as your Phase 2 menu pages:
    - Must start with `<h1>`, followed by structured heading levels (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.)
    - Must include meaningful, organized content.
    - Must include at least one image using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`.
    - Must use semantic HTML5 elements appropriately (e.g., `section`, `article` â€” avoid unnecessary `<div>`s).
    - Must have unique metadata (`<title>`, `description`) in the `<head>`.
- Validate the new pageâ€™s HTML.

âœ… **Commit Message**: `"added and linked new subpage"`
---

## 6. Image Review, Optimization, and Styling (10 points)

- Remove any unused images from your `/img/` folder.
- Ensure images:
  - Use responsive sizing with CSS (`width: 100%`, `height: auto`).
  - Include intrinsic `width` and `height` attributes in the `<img>` tag.
  - Use `loading="lazy"` where appropriate to improve page load speed.
  - Have accessible, meaningful `alt` text.

âœ… You are also allowed to **implement additional image techniques** from **Chapter 16**, such as:
- Using `background-image` in sections.
- Using `background-size: cover` or `contain`.
- Adding simple `box-shadow` or `border-radius` to images.
- Controlling layout shift with correct image dimensions.

âœ… **Note:**  
We will add a **cover image** as part of the **final project polishing step**, so don't worry about that yet!

âœ… **Commit Message**: `"optimized and styled images"`


âœ… **Commit Message**: `"optimized images following best practices"`

---

## 7. HTML5 Outline and Validation (5 points)

- Validate HTML and CSS using W3C tools.
- Verify no untitled sections using an HTML5 Outliner.

âœ… **Commit Message**: `"validation fixes"`

---

## 8. Documentation Requirements (20 points)

**README.md Updates:**
- In your existing `p3/README.md`, add:
  - `## Phase 3 Overview`
    - Describe your Flexbox and Grid usage.
  - `## New Subpage`
    - Describe the purpose of the new page.
  - `## Image Optimization`
    - Summarize your improvements to images.

âœ… You **should update your README.md** throughout Phase 3.  
âœ… You **should update your layout-plan.md** if your structure evolves, but **commit the changes** with meaningful messages.

**In your CSS:**
- Add comments explaining where and why Flexbox or Grid is used.

âœ… **Commit Message Examples**:
- `"added documentation to readme"`
- `"commented css layout sections"`
